# credit_card
My name is Lupita, and I'm working on an intro to JavaScript class using CodeAcademy. I started on Jan 20, 2020. This is the first project I add to my gitHub. 

Project description: This program checks numbers of credit cards to see if they are valid. If they are invalid, the company's name should be printed. 

Language: javaScript
